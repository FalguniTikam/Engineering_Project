<b>Plagiarism Detector</b>

<b>Introduction -</b>
<br>
Hii all, my name is Falguni Tikam, As our PG Project we have selected topic of "Society Management System". </br>

<b> Project Objective -</b>
The objective of a plagiarism checker is to identify instances of plagiarism in a given text by comparing it to a vast database of existing content. The primary goals of a plagiarism checker are:

<b>Detection of Plagiarism</b>

<br>
Identify instances of copied content, including phrases, sentences, or paragraphs, without proper citation or credit.
Detect paraphrased content that may not be exact copies but still convey the same meaning.</br>


<b>Prevention of Academic Dishonesty</b>

<br>
Help maintain academic integrity by discouraging students and researchers from submitting work that is not their own.
Assist educators in identifying instances of plagiarism, enabling them to take appropriate action.
</br>
<b>Improvement of Writing Quality</b>
<br>
Encourage original thinking and writing by providing feedback on the uniqueness of submitted content.
Help writers improve their writing skills by suggesting alternative phrases or sentences to replace plagiarized content.

</br>

<b>Protection of Intellectual Property</b>
<br>
Safeguard original content creators' rights by detecting instances of unauthorized use or copying.
Assist in identifying potential copyright infringement cases.
To achieve these objectives, plagiarism checkers employ various algorithms and techniques, including:</br>

<b>String matching:</b>
<br> Comparing strings of text to identify exact matches.</br>

<b>Fingerprinting:</b>
<br> Creating a unique digital fingerprint of a text to compare with other fingerprints.</br>

<b>Machine learning:</b>
<br> Using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in text.
By using a plagiarism checker, individuals can ensure the originality and authenticity of their work, while also promoting academic integrity and respect for intellectual property.
